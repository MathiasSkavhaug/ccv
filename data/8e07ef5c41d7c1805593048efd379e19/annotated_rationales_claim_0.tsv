warmer	One such study, building species distribution models (SDMs), predicted SARS-CoV-2 risk may remain concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, shifting northward in summer months.
lower	It was found that most of the countries located in the relatively lower temperature region show a rapid increase in the COVID-19 cases than the countries locating in the warmer climatic regions despite their better socio-economic conditions.
unrelated	The COVID-19 epicenters are collocated on global co2 emission hotspots and its distribution maximizes at 7 49 °C, which is 1 35 °C/2 44 °C higher than current (2020) /historical (1961–1990) mean.
nodiff	Thus, there is no scientific reason to confirm that the number of COVID-19 cases in warmer climates is less than that of moderate or cold climates.
warmer	The coronavirus spreads faster in countries with high latitudes and humid climates.
lower	Still, we do find slightly more population scaled viral cases in cooler areas.
nodiff	Our results suggest that, in the absence of effective control measures, significant cases in the coming months are likely to occur in more humid (warmer) climates, irrespective of the climate-dependence of transmission and that summer temperatures will not substantially limit pandemic growth.
lower	Many have speculated that, like SARS, the activity of SARS-CoV-2 will subside when the climate becomes warmer.
lower	Climate and seasonality influence the distributions of many diseases, and studies suggest a link between SARS-CoV-2 and cool weather.
lower	We do find slightly more population-scaled viral cases in cooler areas.
unrelated	On this basis and according to the latest epidemiological researches, both ambient temperature (AT) and population size (PS) can be considered as significant transmissibility factors for coronavirus.
lower	Africa, with a mostly relatively warmer temperature differs from other regions of the world and in addition, has recorded far fewer cases compared to Asian, Europeans and the Americans (North and South).
unrelated	Later, it spreads in colder (−15 °C) and warmer (25 °C) countries, due to faster adaptability in diverse environmental conditions.
