high	Amongst the participants hospitalized with COVID-19, we report that a higher prevalence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 plasma viral load is associated with worse respiratory disease severity, lower absolute lymphocyte counts, and increased markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein and IL-6.
unrelated	CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma are associated with critical illness in COVID-19.
high	CONCLUSION: In this study, patients with moderate and severe COVID19 infection had a higher viral load in respiratory samples, a higher frequency of comorbidities, a higher frequency of hospitalization and a longer hospital stay.
low	However, in hospitalised patients lower C(q)-values were associated with higher risk of severe disease.
high	Patients with chronic cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic pulmonary disease, immunosuppression, obesity and chronic neurological disease had more often high viral load (p-value<0.05 for all).
low	Those with severe disease had a significantly higher IgG index (median: 3.75 vs 0.56, p=0.01) and CRP (median: 8.6 vs 1.0 mg/dL, p<0.001) and D-dimer levels (median: 1.65 vs 0.75 µg/mL; p=0.002) and a significantly lower lymphocyte count (median: 1,176 vs 666 cells/µL, p=0.005) and viral load (median: 8.7×106 vs 2.3×104 copies/mL, p=0.005).
high	The peak viral load was higher in the severe disease group than in the mild group (median cycle threshold value, 36.4 versus 31.5; P = 0.002).
high	In univariate analyses, compared to patients with moderate or low viral load, patients with high viral load were older, had more often comorbidities, developed symptomatic disease, were intubated and died; in addition, patients with high viral load had longer stay in intensive care unit and longer intubation compared to patients with low viral load (p-values <0.05 for all).
nodiff	CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 viral load is not significantly associated with disease severity among different population subsets.
high	Critical patients had higher viral RNA loads in plasma than non-critically ill patients, with non-survivors showing the highest values.
high	Despite variability in animal studies, there was some evidence that increased dose at exposure correlated with higher viral load clinically, and severe symptoms.
nodiff	RESULTS: Asymptomatic patients were found to have higher viral load than the symptomatic patients, though the difference was not found to be statistically significant.
high	Higher baseline viral load was associated with higher mortality, lower likelihood of improvement in clinical status and supplemental oxygenation requirements, and lower rates of hospital discharge.
high	Flow Chart [Image: see text] Prediction of Outcomes Based on Genomic Load [Image: see text] Prediction of Outcomes Based on Genomic Load and Pneumonia Severity Index [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: High genomic load of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples at the time of admission is independently associated with mortality and intubation.
unrelated	Findings Analysis of the biochemical parameters highlighted the increased levels of C-Reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum SGPT, serum SGOT and ferritin in symptomatic patients indicating that patients with higher levels of few biochemical parameters might experience severe pathophysiological complications after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
high	Viral RNA load in plasma correlates with key signatures of dysregulated host responses, suggesting a major role of uncontrolled viral replication in the pathogenesis of this disease.
high	SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, especially plasma viremia, are associated with increased risk of mortality.
high	Importantly, patients with high genomic load were more likely to reach the primary endpoint (p=0.001), and had higher PSI scores on admission (p=0.03).
unrelated	Lower respiratory symptoms were associated with moderate and severe symptoms, while odynophagia, vomiting, and diarrhea were associated with mild clinical symptoms.
high	Whereas, viral load was higher in plasma and serum samples of symptomatic patients suggesting that the development of clinical complications is mostly associated to high viral load in plasma and serum.
high	Viral RNA load in plasma correlated with higher levels of chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2), biomarkers indicative of a systemic inflammatory response (IL-6, CRP, ferritin), activation of NK cells (IL-15), endothelial dysfunction (VCAM-1, angiopoietin-2, ICAM-1), coagulation activation (D-Dimer and INR), tissue damage (LDH, GPT), neutrophil response (neutrophils counts, myeloperoxidase, GM-CSF) and immunodepression (PD-L1, IL-10, lymphopenia and monocytopenia).
unrelated	Fever, either as an exclusive symptom or combined with others, was associated with high viral loads (2ΔΔCt range 35.65-155.16; 4.25-4.89 log10 RNA copies/test]).
nodiff	Overall our study suggests that a high viral load in the upper respiratory tract may not be a critical factor for severe symptoms; rather, dampened antiviral responses may be a critical factor for a severe outcome from the infection.
high	These data indicate that higher viral loads and stronger antibody responses are related to more severe disease status in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the antibodies persisted in the recovered patient for more than 6 months so that the vaccine may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
nodiff	In conclusion, higher concentrations of IgA, IgM, and IgG, and IL-6, IL-8 and MIP-1β are identified as early predictors of COVID-19 severity, whereas no significant association is found between baseline SARS-COV-2 viral load and COVID-19 severity.
unrelated	High genomic load at presentation was associated with higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (p=0.005), transplant recipient status (p< 0.001) and duration of illness less than 7 days (p=0.005).
low	Higher VL was associated with shorter duration of the symptoms in all patients and hospitalized patients only and shorter hospital stay (coefficient =-2.02,-2.61, -2.18; p<0.001, p=0.002, p=0.013, respectively).
unrelated	In multivariate analysis, high genomic load remained an independent predictor of primary outcome.
high	RESULTS: The frequency of viral RNAemia was higher in the critically ill patients (78%) compared to ward patients (27%) and outpatients (2%) (p < 0.001).
